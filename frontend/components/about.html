                The name Bookworm was taken from the original name for New York International Airport, which was renamed JFK in December 1963.

            <p class="about_us_text">
                One of the last travel bookstores in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveler and budget.
            </p>
            <p class="about_us_text">
                We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook, and our well-read, well-traveled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any traveler, book lover, or gift giver.
