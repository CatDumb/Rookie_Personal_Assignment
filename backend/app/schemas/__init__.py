"""
Pydantic schemas package initialization.

This module initializes the schemas package, which contains Pydantic models
for request validation, response serialization, and data transfer objects.
The schemas define the structure of data exchanged through the API.
"""

# This file makes the 'schemas' directory a Python package.
# You can optionally import schemas here for easier access, e.g.:
# from .user import UserRead
# from .book import BookRead

# Currently empty to allow future selective imports if needed
# Example of potential future usage:
# from .user import UserRead, UserCreate
# from .book import BookRead, BookCreate
#
# __all__ = [
#     "UserRead", "UserCreate",
#     "BookRead", "BookCreate",
# ]
